# photix

Your pro-photo, pocket operating system
debian re-spin.

About the project

I needed it, so I built it; photix is a portable operating system (OS) aimed at photographers, creatives or anyone looking for a go anywhere, boot anything desktop that can be used to download photos from a digital camera, perform sophisticated raw photo processing and editing, browse the web and more. The iso image can be written to a usb stick or burned to a cd and since photix is a 'live' linux os, it runs entirely in memory and doesn't require installation. If you like it, you can also use it as a base for your own project or even install it on your computer for a clean, fast and modern desktop experience.

features

raw photo processing – powerful photo library management and raw processing with darktable (think lightroom)

system utilities – comes with a set of standard system utilities; file manager, terminal etc.
